Rules:
1. There are a total of 3 rounds in the game where players participate individually.
2. The time given for preparation and the actual speech timings will vary among the rounds.
3. The participants will be given 5 main topics and under each topic there will be 5 differing concepts related to it, which the participants will be speaking about.
4. Participants' access to the internet will be allowed or restricted based on each round's rules.
5. The participants will be provided with a laptop for the span of their preparation time and they will not be allowed to use their own devices.
6. In addition to presenting their monologue, participants will be given certain constraints/tasks randomly assigned by the organizers during each round. These tasks must be followed simultaneously while delivering the monologue.
The nature and difficulty of these tasks will vary from round to round and may be grouped based on the round (for example, performance-based, vocal, physical, or stylistic constraints). Exact tasks for each round will be revealed on the spot.

Game structure:

Round 1:
➢ Each participant can choose their own topic and then they will spin a wheel to pick a concept from that topic.
➢ Each participant will have 3 minutes to prepare for the round after picking the concept.
➢ Access to the internet and AI Tools is permitted in this round.
➢ After preparation, they have to speak for exactly a minute.

Round 2:
➢ Each participant will be allotted a topic randomly by the organizers and then they will spin a wheel to pick a concept from that topic.
➢ Each participant will have 3 minutes to prepare for the round after picking the concept.
➢ Access to the internet is allowed but AI Tools is prohibited in this round.
➢ After preparation, they have to speak for exactly a minute

Round 3:
➢ Each participant can choose their own topic (even the one they already chose) and then they will spin a wheel to pick a concept from that topic.
➢ Each participant will have 2 minutes to prepare for the round after picking the concept.
➢ Access to the internet and AI Tools are both not allowed in this round.
➢ After preparation, they have to speak for exactly two minutes

Judging Criteria:
Participants will be judged on both:
• The quality of their monologue (clarity, creativity, structure, engagement, and relevance to the topic)
• How effectively they complete and incorporate the assigned task/constraint while speaking
Failure to follow the assigned task may result in point deductions.

NOTE:
● Points will be taken off if the participant does not stick to the time limit.
● The elimination in each round and the no. of slots will be based on the initial intake count.`,

Success depends on a combination of game strategy, technical knowledge, and quick analytical thinking, making Techie XO an engaging and competitive test of both skill and intellect.

Game Format:
● All rounds follow a knockout format.
● For each round, questions will be announced or displayed to all participants simultaneously.
● Turns will be decided using a buzzer system.
● Only the participant who correctly answers a question gets the chance to place their mark on the XO board.
● If a participant answers incorrectly, the opponent gets a chance to answer and place the mark if their answer is correct.
● If both participants answer incorrectly or do not answer, the turn is skipped.

Board & Questions:
● All preliminary rounds use a 3×3 XO board (9 questions).
● The final round uses a 4×4 XO board (16 questions).
● All questions are strictly based on technical knowledge.

Match Decisions:
● If a match ends in a draw, the participant who has answered the highest number of questions correctly will qualify.
● A leaderboard is maintained based on the number of moves used to win a game.
● Participants who win using the least number of moves will rank higher on the leaderboard.

Final Round Special Rules:
● Before each question in the final round, the team must decide which teammate will answer.
● Only one question in the final round allows both teammates to answer together.
● If the final match ends in a draw and both teams have answered the same number of questions correctly, tie-breaker questions will be asked.
● In a tie-breaker, the participant who answers correctly gets a chance to remove one opponent’s mark and place their own mark in that position.`,

Why Attend?
This workshop is designed for learners who want to truly understand computer vision, not just call prebuilt APIs. Instead of treating deep learning frameworks as magic, you will break down how vision models work internally from pixels and convolutions to transformers and modern architectures. By comparing PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TinyGrad, and building models directly in TinyGrad, you will gain a rare, low-level perspective on deep learning systems. No prior computer vision experience is required, only basic programming knowledge.`,

    description: `Workshop Write-Up:
Large Language Models like GPT are often seen as intelligent, safe, and reliable systems. But under the hood, they are predictive machines driven by prompts, patterns, and probabilities—and that makes them hackable in non-traditional ways.
This workshop dives into the concept of hacking GPT, not by exploiting servers or writing malware, but by manipulating behavior through language itself. Participants will explore how carefully crafted prompts can bypass restrictions, influence outputs, extract unintended information, or cause the model to behave in unsafe or misleading ways.

What Will Be Covered:
- What “Hacking GPT” Really Means
- How GPT Interprets Prompts Internally
- Prompt Injection and Manipulation Techniques
- Bypassing Rules and Behavioral Constraints
- Data Inference and Indirect Information Extraction
- Abuse Cases of GPT in the Real World
- Why LLMs Are Hard to Secure

Key Takeaways:
- Understanding GPT as a system that can be manipulated through language
- Insight into real prompt-based attack techniques
- Awareness of how attackers misuse LLMs
- Ability to recognize weak points in GPT-style systems
- Strong foundation for further study in AI security and red teaming`,

    description: `Workshop Overview:
Chatbots are impressive — they can answer questions, write text, and hold conversations. But what if AI could do more than just reply? What if it could take actions, use tools, make decisions, and work toward goals?
That’s where Agentic AI comes in. In this beginner-friendly workshop, you’ll be introduced to the world of AI agents — systems that go beyond chatting and actually act. You’ll learn how modern AI agents think, plan, and interact with tools, and by the end of the session, you’ll build your very first AI agent.
No heavy theory. No complex math. Just clear concepts, intuitive design, and a simple hands-on experience to get you started.

What You’ll Learn:
1. Why Chatbots Are Not Enough: Understand the limitations of traditional chat-based AI and why real-world tasks need more than responses.
2. What Is Agentic AI?: Learn what makes an AI system “agentic” — goals, actions, tools, and autonomy.
3. Chatbots vs AI Agents: Clearly distinguish between a chatbot and an AI agent using simple examples and visual thinking.
4. Core Building Blocks of an AI Agent: Explore the basic components of an agent: instructions, tools, decision flow, and simple memory.
5. Build Your First AI Agent: Create a small but functional AI agent that can act, not just respond.

Agenda (1.5-Hour Workshop):
0:00 – 0:15 | Warm-Up & Introduction
0:15 – 1:00 | Understanding Agentic AI
1:00 – 1:30 | Hands-On: Build Your First Agent

Takeaways:
- A clear understanding of what Agentic AI is and why it matters
- Ability to differentiate chatbots from AI agents
- Hands-on experience building a basic AI agent
- Starter code and templates to continue exploring on your own`,

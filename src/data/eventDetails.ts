    description: `PODCAST MONOLOGUE:

Rules:
1. There are a total of 3 rounds in the game where players participate individually.
2. The time given for preparation and the actual speech timings will vary among the rounds.
3. The participants will be given 5 main topics and under each topic there will be 5 differing concepts related to it, which the participants will be speaking about.
4. Participants' access to the internet will be allowed or restricted based on each round's rules.
5. The participants will be provided with a laptop for the span of their preparation time and they will not be allowed to use their own devices.
6. In addition to presenting their monologue, participants will be given certain constraints/tasks randomly assigned by the organizers during each round. These tasks must be followed simultaneously while delivering the monologue.
The nature and difficulty of these tasks will vary from round to round and may be grouped based on the round (for example, performance-based, vocal, physical, or stylistic constraints). Exact tasks for each round will be revealed on the spot.

Game structure:

Round 1:
➢ Each participant can choose their own topic and then they will spin a wheel to pick a concept from that topic.
➢ Each participant will have 3 minutes to prepare for the round after picking the concept.
➢ Access to the internet and AI Tools is permitted in this round.
➢ After preparation, they have to speak for exactly a minute.

Round 2:
➢ Each participant will be allotted a topic randomly by the organizers and then they will spin a wheel to pick a concept from that topic.
➢ Each participant will have 3 minutes to prepare for the round after picking the concept.
➢ Access to the internet is allowed but AI Tools is prohibited in this round.
➢ After preparation, they have to speak for exactly a minute

Round 3:
➢ Each participant can choose their own topic (even the one they already chose) and then they will spin a wheel to pick a concept from that topic.
➢ Each participant will have 2 minutes to prepare for the round after picking the concept.
➢ Access to the internet and AI Tools are both not allowed in this round.
➢ After preparation, they have to speak for exactly two minutes

Judging Criteria:
Participants will be judged on both:
• The quality of their monologue (clarity, creativity, structure, engagement, and relevance to the topic)
• How effectively they complete and incorporate the assigned task/constraint while speaking
Failure to follow the assigned task may result in point deductions.

NOTE:
● Points will be taken off if the participant does not stick to the time limit.
● The elimination in each round and the no. of slots will be based on the initial intake count.`,

    description: `Techie XO is a high-energy technical event that blends the classic XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game with technical and logical problem-solving. Participants compete one-on-one, where each move on the board is earned by correctly answering technical or logic-based questions. Success depends on a combination of game strategy, technical knowledge, and quick analytical thinking, making Techie XO an engaging and competitive test of both skill and intellect.

Game Format:
● All rounds follow a knockout format.
● For each round, questions will be announced or displayed to all participants simultaneously.
● Turns will be decided using a buzzer system.
● Only the participant who correctly answers a question gets the chance to place their mark on the XO board.
● If a participant answers incorrectly, the opponent gets a chance to answer and place the mark if their answer is correct.
● If both participants answer incorrectly or do not answer, the turn is skipped.

Board & Questions:
● All preliminary rounds use a 3×3 XO board (9 questions).
● The final round uses a 4×4 XO board (16 questions).
● All questions are strictly based on technical knowledge.

Match Decisions:
● If a match ends in a draw, the participant who has answered the highest number of questions correctly will qualify.
● A leaderboard is maintained based on the number of moves used to win a game.
● Participants who win using the least number of moves will rank higher on the leaderboard.

Final Round Special Rules:
● Before each question in the final round, the team must decide which teammate will answer.
● Only one question in the final round allows both teammates to answer together.
● If the final match ends in a draw and both teams have answered the same number of questions correctly, tie-breaker questions will be asked.
● In a tie-breaker, the participant who answers correctly gets a chance to remove one opponent’s mark and place their own mark in that position.`,

Each correct answer gives a player the chance to burst their opponent’s balloon, inside every balloon is a dare, and that the opponent has to do it. The game continues in this solve-and-burst format, and the player with the most balloons left at the end emerges as the winner.

ROUND 1:
Participants face medium‑level questions from topics like logical reasoning, lines and angles, riddles, and distance & speed. Matches are played in a one‑vs‑one format, with each player answering six questions. At the end of each match, the winner blasts the opponent’s balloon, revealing a dare. Balloon counts are tracked to decide who moves forward.

ROUND 2:
Qualified teams from Round 1 face harder questions in the same topics. Again, matches are one‑vs‑one, with each player answering six questions. Winners continue to blast balloons, and the balloon count is used to determine the overall winner. The event concludes at the end of Round 2, where the final winner is announced.`,

Challenge
ProtoPitch is an innovation-driven event where participants design and pitch a working prototype using n8n, a powerful low-code automation tool. The event focuses on transforming real-world problems into automated and AI-enabled solutions through visual workflows.
In this edition, participants will build a basic AI Chat Box that accepts user input, processes it using an AI model, and delivers intelligent responses automatically. The event encourages creativity, logical thinking, and practical implementation rather than heavy coding.
Participants will gain hands-on exposure to workflow automation, AI integration, and real-time data processing, making this event ideal for beginners as well as tech enthusiasts. Teams or individuals will present their prototype, explain the workflow, and pitch its real-world impact to the judging panel.
ProtoPitch aims to bridge the gap between ideas and implementation by empowering students to build industry-relevant automation solutions using modern low-code Technology.

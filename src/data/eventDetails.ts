Team Format:
Participants compete in teams (2 members per team). Each round eliminates teams based on performance.

Round 1: Tech Logo Identification (Time-Based Round)
Participants will be shown various technology-related logos on the screen. They must identify each logo correctly within a limited time. Scoring is based on the number of correct answers.

Round 2: Tech Audio & Jumbled Words (Dual Challenge Round)
• Tech Audio Guessing: Participants listen to short technology-related audio clips and identify them correctly.
• Jumbled Words: Participants solve scrambled technical terms within the given time.

Round 3: Pick, Draw & Guess (Final & Fun Round)
One participant from the team picks a random technical term from a box and draws clues related to it. The other participant must guess the correct technical term based only on the drawing. RULES: No words, letters, numbers, or verbal hints are allowed.

Winning Criteria:
Teams with the highest scores and fastest correct answers advance. The final round determines the winner of Tech Tamasha.`,

ROUND 1:
Participants face medium‑level questions from topics like logical reasoning, lines and angles, riddles, and distance & speed. Matches are played in a one‑vs‑one format, with each player answering six questions. At the end of each match, the winner blasts the opponent’s balloon, revealing a dare. Balloon counts are tracked to decide who moves forward.

ROUND 2:
Qualified teams from Round 1 face harder questions in the same topics. Again, matches are one‑vs‑one, with each player answering six questions. Winners continue to blast balloons, and the balloon count is used to determine the overall winner. The event concludes at the end of Round 2, where the final winner is announced.`,

This event is ideal for students interested in design, product thinking, UI/UX, and technology, regardless of prior professional experience.

Task Details:
• Participants must design a website UI based on the problem statement provided on the spot.
• The entire design must be created within the given time limit using Figma only.
• The design should primarily focus on:
  o Layout clarity – clean structure and proper alignment
  o User experience (UX) – ease of navigation and usability
  o Visual consistency – consistent colors, fonts, and components
• Participants are expected to create multiple screens/pages as required by the problem statement.
• The final output should be a clickable Figma prototype that demonstrates the complete user flow.

Round 1: Website Design Challenge
Objective: To design a clear, visually consistent, and user-friendly website UI using Figma that effectively addresses the given problem statement.
Participants are expected to demonstrate:
• Strong layout structure
• Intuitive user experience (UX)
• Consistent visual design elements
The focus is on translating the problem statement into a well-organized, multi-page website interface within the allotted time.

Judging Criteria (Total: 100 Marks):
1️ Problem Understanding – 20 Marks
2️ UI Design (Visual Quality) – 20 Marks
3️ UX & Usability – 20 Marks
